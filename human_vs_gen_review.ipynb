The on-screen chemistry between Aditya Roy Kapur and Shraddha Kapoor is a significant strength, lending emotional weight to the story.

Aditya Roy Kapur and Shraddha Kapoor were just perfect as RJ and Aarohi. You totally buy into their love story, which makes his struggle with alcoholism so much more painful to watch. Yeah, the plot is basically a desi A Star Is Born, and there were times I wanted to shake RJ and tell him to get it together.
