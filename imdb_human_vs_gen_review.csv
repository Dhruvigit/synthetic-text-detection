"A refreshingly mature and realistic take on the family drama genre in Bollywood. The film expertly handles complex themes with a light touch, backed by fantastic performances from the entire ensemble. It's both funny and deeply moving.",1
A masterful psychological thriller that is as intelligent as it is terrifying. The dynamic between Jodie Foster's Clarice Starling and Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter is one of cinema's most iconic pairings. It's a chilling and perfectly crafted film.,1
A clever and thought-provoking social satire that uses an alien's perspective to question religious dogma and superstition. Aamir Khan is brilliant as the innocent and curious PK. Rajkumar Hirani delivers another film that entertains while leaving you with something to think about.,1

"While a technical marvel at the time of its release, 'Avatar' is a narrative disaster. The story is a painfully predictable rehash of 'Dances with Wolves' and 'Pocahontas', with one-dimensional characters and cringe-worthy dialogue. All style, no substance.",1
"Vishal Bhardwaj's adaptation of Hamlet set against the backdrop of the Kashmir conflict is a stunning and haunting masterpiece. Shahid Kapoor gives a career-best performance, and the film is visually poetic and politically brave.",1
"Peter Jackson's adaptation of Tolkien's epic is a monumental achievement in filmmaking. It perfectly captures the scale and heart of the source material, with breathtaking visuals, a brilliant cast, and a powerful sense of adventure.",1
"A heartwarming cross-border story that champions humanity over politics. Salman Khan delivers one of his most sincere performances, and the young Harshaali Malhotra is incredibly endearing. A film that beautifully promotes a message of love and peace.",1

"Steven Spielberg's 'Jurassic Park' is a cinematic marvel that brought dinosaurs to life in a way no one had ever seen. The sense of wonder and terror is palpable, and John Williams' score is iconic. It's a perfect adventure film that still holds up today.",1

"The Coen Brothers' neo-western is a bleak, tense, and masterfully directed thriller. Javier Bardem's portrayal of Anton Chigurh is one of cinema's most terrifying villains. It's a dark and meditative film about fate and violence.",1
"Danny Boyle's vibrant and energetic film is a modern fairy tale set in the slums of Mumbai. Its unique narrative structure, tied to a game show, is brilliant, and A.R. Rahman's Oscar-winning music is the heartbeat of the story. A true crowd-pleaser.",1
"The gold standard for sequels. 'The Empire Strikes Back' is a darker, more complex, and emotionally resonant film than its predecessor. It deepens the mythology, develops the characters, and features one of the most iconic plot twists in history.",1

"Christopher Nolan's film about rival magicians is a complex and endlessly re-watchable puzzle box. The narrative is a brilliant act of misdirection itself, with a dark and obsessive story that culminates in a stunning reveal.",1
"A relentless, jaw-dropping, and visually spectacular action masterpiece. George Miller creates a non-stop two-hour chase scene that is a marvel of practical effects and kinetic filmmaking. An absolute adrenaline rush from start to finish.",1
A powerful and important courtroom drama that delivers a resounding statement on consent. The film is anchored by a commanding performance from Amitabh Bachchan and a stellar supporting cast. Its dialogue and message are vital and impactful.,1
"A dark and epic tale of greed, oil, and madness at the turn of the century. Daniel Day-Lewis delivers one of the greatest performances ever recorded as the monstrous Daniel Plainview. A chilling and unforgettable character study.",1
"While the film features a phenomenal, career-defining performance from Ranbir Kapoor and a legendary music album by A.R. Rahman, its non-linear narrative can be confusing and the plot feels emotionally overwrought. A flawed but passionate piece of cinema.",1
"Jawan was an absolute blast, no kidding! Shah Rukh Khan just owns the screen in every single frame, right? The action was crazy good, and the story actually kept you hooked. A total mass entertainer, felt like a proper Bollywood blockbuster after ages. Go watch it for the SRK swag!",1
"Okay, so Oppenheimer. Wow. My brain is still trying to process everything. It wasn't just a history lesson, it was intense, you know? Cillian Murphy was absolutely phenomenal, he carried the whole thing. Totally worth the hype, but definitely not a light watch. Left me thinking for days.",1
"Barbie was way more than I expected! Like, I went in thinking it'd be just pink and silly, but it actually had so much heart and some really sharp commentary. Ryan Gosling as Ken was hilarious, and Margot Robbie totally nailed it. It's funny, it's poignant, it's just a good time. Go see it!",1
"Gadar 2 was pure nostalgia fuel! If you loved the first one, you'll get a kick out of this. Sunny Deol is back doing what he does best, smashing stuff and roaring. Yeah, the plot might be a bit over-the-top, but who cares? It's Gadar! It's meant to be loud and fun. Had a great time.",1
"Pathaan? More like fire-thaan! SRK back in action, and oh boy, did he deliver. It was non-stop action, slick visuals, and just pure adrenaline. Deepika and John were awesome too. Yeah, the story isn't groundbreaking, but honestly, who cares when it's this entertaining? Total popcorn flick.",1
"I'm still convinced EEAAO broke my brain in the best way possible. Seriously, what a ride! It's bizarre, hilarious, heartbreaking, and just so creative. Michelle Yeoh deserves all the awards, honestly. If you haven't seen it, stop reading this and go watch it. It's a masterpiece.",1
"Animal was... a lot. Like, a LOT. Ranbir Kapoor went all out, no doubt about that, super intense. But man, it was also super violent and kinda messed up? Definitely not for everyone, had some parts that made me uncomfortable. But you can't deny it leaves an impact.",1
"Shershaah hit me right in the feels. What a tribute to Captain Vikram Batra. Sidharth Malhotra was surprisingly good, really captured the essence of the guy. It's one of those war movies that makes you feel so proud but also incredibly sad. Highly recommend, bring tissues.",1
"Okay, Top Gun: Maverick was absolutely incredible in IMAX. The aerial sequences? Mind-blowing. Literally had my jaw on the floor. Tom Cruise still got it, proving he's the real action star. It's everything a blockbuster should be: thrilling, epic, and just cool. Go fly high!",1
"Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2 was a fun time! Kartik Aaryan stepped into Akshay's shoes pretty well, brought his own charm. It had its funny moments and a few decent scares. Not as classic as the original, but a solid entertainer for a night out. Worth a watch for the laughs.",1
"K.G.F. Chapter 2 was exactly what I wanted: bigger, louder, and even more Yash! The slow-motion, the dialogues, the absolute swagger – it's pure mass cinema. Yeah, it’s a bit over the top, but that’s the point, isn't it? If you loved the first, you’ll love this. Solid sequel.",1
"Drishyam 2 was so smart, seriously. Just when you think you've got it figured out, BAM! Ajay Devgn and Akshaye Khanna were brilliant, constantly trying to outsmart each other. It's one of those thrillers that keeps you guessing until the very end. Don't spoil it for anyone!",1
"Visually, Avatar 2 was stunning, no denying that. The underwater stuff? Absolutely breathtaking, like nothing I've ever seen. But the story... it felt a bit stretched, honestly. Beautiful to look at, but I was checking my watch once or twice. Still, a spectacle.",1
"RRR was an absolute adrenaline rush! Telugu cinema on a whole new level. The action sequences were insane, like, cartoonishly good but still epic. Ram Charan and Jr. NTR had incredible chemistry. It’s loud, it’s grand, it’s just pure cinematic fun. Totally get the hype now!",1
"I'm still thinking about Alia Bhatt in Gangubai. It was more than just a performance; she completely became this person. The story is so haunting and powerful, and Bhansali made every single shot look like a masterpiece. It's a dark world, for sure, but the strength she shows just shines right through it all. It didn't just entertain me, it genuinely moved me.",1
"OH MY GOD, NO WAY HOME! I was literally screaming in the theater! I don't want to spoil anything, but every time a certain character showed up, the whole audience just erupted. It was pure, unfiltered joy. They gave us everything we wanted and more. I left the cinema buzzing with energy. Best Spidey movie, no question!",1
"Dude, Pushpa is not a movie, it's a vibe! Allu Arjun's attitude as Pushpa Raj is just on another level. The walk, the talk, everything. Every dialogue is a punchline, and the songs make you want to get up and dance. It’s pure 'mass' cinema done right. It's not about the story, it's about the SWAG. 'Jhukega nahi saala!",1
"My head is still spinning from Vikram. This isn't just an action movie; it's a masterfully woven puzzle. Kamal Haasan is a legend, obviously, but the way everything connects to his other films and the wider universe... it's just genius-level stuff. The action is brutal and top-notch, but it's the cleverness of the plot that really blew my mind.",1
"I wanted to love Brahm?stra, I really did. The concept is so cool! But the DIALOGUE? 'Shiva, tum button ho'? I was cringing in my seat. They had this epic world and spent half the movie on a romance with zero chemistry and lines that a five-year-old would find cheesy. Such a massive, wasted opportunity. It actually made me angry",1
"Forget the rest of the movie, let's just talk about the last 20 minutes of Kantara. I have never experienced anything like that in a theater. It was primal, terrifying, and absolutely divine. I had goosebumps on my goosebumps. Rishab Shetty's performance was something else entirely. It wasn't acting; it was a possession. Left me speechless.",1
"I respect Sam Manekshaw, but watching Sam Bahadur felt like reading a Wikipedia page for two and a half hours. Vicky Kaushal did a great job with the mannerisms, but the movie itself had no drama, no tension. It was just 'this happened, then this happened, then this happened.' It felt more like a documentary than a film. I was honestly just bored.",1
"If you missed Laapataa Ladies, you're seriously missing out on a gem. It was such a breath of fresh air! The whole idea of two brides getting swapped on a train is so simple but they made it so funny and heartwarming. All the actors felt like real people you'd meet in a village, not some big stars, which made you root for them even more. It’s one of those rare movies that makes you laugh out loud while also leaving you with a really sweet message about finding your own way. Just a pure, feel-good film that will leave you smiling.",1
"So, 'Crew' is supposed to be a fun heist comedy? It felt more like a super long, glitzy ad for fancy handbags and airlines. The plot was so thin you could see right through it, and the jokes felt like they were written by a corporate committee. Yeah, the leading ladies looked great, but there's just nothing there. Totally mindless and forgettable.",1
"Gully Boy was such an inspiring watch. Ranveer Singh was just phenomenal, completely disappeared into the role of Murad. The music, the struggle, the triumph – it all felt so real. Zoya Akhtar did an amazing job telling that story. It makes you root for the underdog!",1
"F+A2:A76inally got around to re-watching Kalki 2898 AD, and man, it's still just as wild. The visuals are absolutely insane, probably the best I've seen come out of India, and seeing Big B as Ashwatthama on the big screen was something else. Prabhas and Deepika were solid, but honestly, Bujji the AI car stole the whole show for me. The only thing is, the story is a total head-scratcher. They throw so much lore and mythology at you that it's tough to keep up in one go. It's a massive, beautiful, and confusing epic that you have to see, but be ready to feel a little lost afterwards.",1
"I thought this was a wonderful way to spend time on a too hot summer weekend, sitting in the air conditioned theater and watching a light-hearted comedy. The plot is simplistic, but the dialogue is witty and the characters are likable (even the well bread suspected serial killer). While some may be disappointed when they realize this is not Match Point 2: Risk Addiction, I thought it was proof that Woody Allen is still fully in control of the style many of us have grown to love.This was the most I'd laughed at one of Woody's comedies in years (dare I say a decade?). While I've never been impressed with Scarlet Johanson, in this she managed to tone down her ""sexy"" image and jumped right into a average, but spirited young woman.This may not be the crown jewel of his career, but it was wittier than ""Devil Wears Prada"" and more interesting than ""Superman"" a great comedy to go see with friends.",0
"This show was an amazing, fresh & innovative idea in the 70's when it first aired. The first 7 or 8 years were brilliant, but things dropped off after that. By 1990, the show was not really funny anymore, and it's continued its decline further to the complete waste of time it is today.It's truly disgraceful how far this show has fallen. The writing is painfully bad, the performances are almost as bad - if not for the mildly entertaining respite of the guest-hosts, this show probably wouldn't still be on the air. I find it so hard to believe that the same creator that hand-selected the original cast also chose the band of hacks that followed. How can one recognize such brilliance and then see fit to replace it with such mediocrity? I felt I must give 2 stars out of respect for the original cast that made this show such a huge success. As it is now, the show is just awful. I can't believe it's still on the air.",0
"Encouraged by the positive comments about this film on here I was looking forward to watching this film. Bad mistake. I've seen 950+ films and this is truly one of the worst of them - it's awful in almost every way: editing, pacing, storyline, 'acting,' soundtrack (the film's only song - a lame country tune - is played no less than four times). The film looks cheap and nasty and is boring in the extreme. Rarely have I been so happy to see the end credits of a film. The only thing that prevents me giving this a 1-score is Harvey Keitel - while this is far from his best performance he at least seems to be making a bit of an effort. One for Keitel obsessives only.",0
"The cast played Shakespeare.Shakespeare lost.I appreciate that this is trying to bring Shakespeare to the masses, but why ruin something so good.Is it because 'The Scottish Play' is my favorite Shakespeare? I do not know. What I do know is that a certain Rev Bowdler (hence bowdlerization) tried to do something similar in the Victorian era.In other words, you cannot improve perfection.I have no more to write but as I have to write at least ten lines of text (and English composition was never my forte I will just have to keep going and say that this movie, as the saying goes, just does not cut it.",0
"Some films just simply should not be remade. This is one of them. In and of itself it is not a bad film. But it fails to capture the flavor and the terror of the 1963 film of the same title. Liam Neeson was excellent as he always is, and most of the cast holds up, with the exception of Owen Wilson, who just did not bring the right feel to the character of Luke. But the major fault with this version is that it strayed too far from the Shirley Jackson story in it's attempts to be grandiose and lost some of the thrill of the earlier film in a trade off for snazzier special effects. Again I will say that in and of itself it is not a bad film. But you will enjoy the friction of terror in the older version much more.",0
"Well made documentary focusing on two Sudanese refugees who get resettled in the United States. It's your basic fish out of water story with a non-fiction twist. I found it fascinating to see how Peter and Santino lived prior to coming to America and how they adapted once they arrived here (in Houston, Texas.) They expected a sort of heaven but found out that it's a lot harder than it looks to cope well in the states. They go from hopeful idealists to somewhat more realistic skeptics. Everywhere they go they meet bureaucrats with paper trails that most citizens may take for granted. They fret that they are blacker than the African-Americans here and don't feel accepted because of that. One of the ""Lost Boys"" manages to leave Houston to go to Olathe, Kansas, where he finds conditions slightly better but still less than ideal. There are people that try to help them as well as try to hurt them in this film. Not shown, but talked about, are those who put a gun to their heads and robbed them, leading one Lost Boy to comment negatively that ""all black people in America are no good."" I found it interesting, too, that they arrived in Houston in August 2001, a month before the World Trade Center was attacked by terrorists. I had hoped to see their reaction to this tragedy but it's not mentioned at all. Still, all in all, a really well done documentary with no narration. None is needed really. The ""Lost Boys"" do a fine job expounding on the events going on around them without any help at all, thank you very much.",0
"This production was made in the middle 1980s, and appears to be the first serious attempt to put BLEAK HOUSE on celluloid. No film version of the novel was ever attempted (it is remarkably rich in subplots that actually serve as counterpoints to each other, so that it would have been very hard to prune it down). The novel was the only attempt by Dickens to make a central narrator (one of two in the work) a woman, Esther Summerson. Esther is raised by her aunt and uncle, who (in typical Dickens style) mistreat her. She is illegitimate, but they won't tell her anything about her parentage. Later we get involved with the gentry, Sir Leicester Dedlock, and his wife. Lady Honoria Deadlock (Dame Diana Rigg) is having an increasingly difficult time regarding her private life and the meddling involvement of the family solicitor Tulkinghorn (Peter Vaughn). We also are involved with the actions of Richard Carstone (Esther's boyfriend) in trying to win a long drawn out estate chancery case, Jarndyce v. Jarndyce, which everyone (even Richard's cousin John Jarndyce - played by Desmond Elliot) warns is not worth the effort.Dickens had been a law reporter and then a parliamentary reporter before he wrote fiction. Starting with the breach of promise case in PICKWICK PAPERS, Dickens looked closely at the law. Mr. Bumble said it was ""a ass"" in OLIVER TWIST and Dickens would consistently support that view. He looks at the slums as breeding grounds for crime in TWIST, that the law barely tries to cure. He attacks the Chancery and outdated estate laws, as well as too powerful solicitors and greedy lawyers (Tulkinghorn, Vholes) in BLEAK HOUSE. In LITTLE DORRIT he attacks the debtors' prisons (he had hit it also in David COPPERFIELD). In OUR MUTUAL FRIEND he looks at testators and wills. In THE MYSTERY OF EDWIN DROOD he apparently was going to go to a murder trial. Dickens was far more critical of legal institutions than most of his contemporaries, including Thackeray.But the novel also looks at other problems (like charity and religious hypocrisy, the budding Scotland Yard detective force, social snobbery in the industrial revolution). He also uses the novel to satirize various people: Leigh Hunt the writer, Inspector Fields of Scotland Yard, and even the notorious Maria Manning. Most of these points were kept in this fine mini-series version. If it is shown again on a cable station, catch it.",0
"Without a doubt, the best Burt Reynolds film ever! Even better than Smokey and the Bandit. This was probably the first real bloody cop thriller of the 1980s and delivered the perfect blend of humor, action, mystery and style that is missing in today's films.This one has it all: A psychotic Henry Silva jacked up on PCP, $1,000 a night call girls, ninja assassins and Burt Reynolds getting his fingers sliced off, one by one, with a butterfly knife. The film is based on the novel by William Diehl who also wrote PRIMAL FEAR, another one of my all-time favorites. This movie is worth watching just to see Henry Silva get shot six times, crash through a window, and fall thirty stories from the top of an Atlanta high-rise. This is probably the coolest stunt in Hollywood history, performed by legendary stuntman Dar Robinson.Robinson also played ""Moke"" in the Elmore Leonard movie STICK, also starring Burt Reynolds. Stick features another great Dar Robinson stunt. Robinson falls from a Miami apartment building and unloads all six shots from a .44 magnum on his way down. Very cool stuff.SHARKY'S MACHINE is my favorite police drama. I never understood why this film flopped the way it did. If Burt did more films like this, he would've built a better reputation for himself. He proves to be a talented director with Sharky, as well as a gifted actor. Burt is supported by Brian Kieth, Charles Durning, Bernie Casey, Richard Libertini, Rachel Ward, and everyone's favorite bad guy Henry Silva. PLEASE remake this classic film! Get Affleck and Samuel L. and some other hot actors and you've got a great movie just waiting to be filmed.I give it a 9 out of 10",0
"Dark Harvest is a very low budget production made by a bunch of rank amateurs which manages to come off as a kind of semi-professional movie. Unfortunately the poor effects, wooden acting and unoriginal story makes this a very mediocre horror slasher at best. By no means is Dark Harvest the worst horror movie i've ever seen, it just isn't anything special and has nothing in it to warrant a second watch or hope for a sequel. You know a director has doubts about their own horror film when a) there is some pointless nudity and b) the movie's so short they add some rather boring outtakes at the end credits that nobody really cares about because the movie wasn't that good! A slightly better movie which i can't help feeling was the inspiration for Dark Harvest is the eighties movie 'Scarecrows' which is an OK movie but still pretty average.Dark Harvest isn't as bad as some of the other comments say it is but don't think that you will be entertained much either. One thing i also have to comment on is the character of Angela who has a really terrible English accent! What was the point in that?! To maybe give it a certain touch of class? Yeah right! English people do NOT say ""WAAHTAAH"" when they mean to say ""water"" and i don't care what part of England they are from! If you can't find a genuine English actress or a non-English actress who can put on a brilliant English accent (not many of them about) then DON'T BOTHER! Sheesh! Final score: 4/10",0
As a Czech I am very pleased when I read these comments here. I am absolutely sure that this film is great. And what you maybe don't know is that story was specially written for Mr. BrodskÃ½. The man you can see is him and his typical attitude - to live and to resist death. He was one of great actors and we are very lucky that we he has made so many beautiful films during his life. You are lucky you could see at least one of them. Enjoy.,0
"I rented this DVD for two reasons. A cast of great actors, and the director, even though Robert Altman can be hit or miss. In this case, it was a big miss. Altman's attempt at creating suspense fell on its keester. After seeing Kenneth Branagh in a good film like ""Dead Again"", I didn't think he could possibly contribute to such a turkey, and I hope it didn't ruin his reputation. Robert Duvall seems to have fallen the way of most one-time Oscar winners. On a downward spiral that includes acting in eating-money films such as this one. Duvall was once a great actor in excellent films, even though his best performance was not ""Tender Mercies"", but ""The Great Santini"". This movie was truly a big waste of time. I give it a 2 out of 10.",0
"Ah, here it is! A movie, which is said by people to remind me of the epic ""Trainspotting"". OUCH, was I a fool to believe that, and OUCH, how my buttocks hurt after having forced myself to watch this c**p from beginning to end. After the first 10-15 minutes I just wanted it all to end, or at least they could've put some nudity or action or cool acid house music into it to make it worth the time... But no, when I was through with it, i put it into my CD shelf and I hope I will never have to pick it out again just to show it to some friend who is so anxious to see it that he/she don't want to listen to my warnings.",0
"Your first clue that this is a cheesy movie is that it was shot on video, not film. The story is convoluted, and the production is amazingly sloppy. Note, for example, that when the title couple are on a plane ostensibly landing in Vermont, where they've gone to celebrate their relationship in a civil union ceremony, the plane is shown coming into an airport surrounded by palm trees. Their ceremony - in Vermont - takes place in a garden of tropical plants, including palms, which wouldn't last five minutes in the New England climate. On yet another airplane trip, the establishing shot depicts a FedEx cargo plane taking off. Presumably they could only afford to travel in steerage. As for the plot, this movie expects you to believe that Victor, the devoutly Christian brother of Arthur, is kicked out of his church when the congregation learns that his BROTHER is gay. Not only that, but the pastor eventually sets Victor up with a hit man to have Ben and Arthur killed ""to purge their souls of sin."" Apparently no one in this church has ever heard of the Ten Commandments. Were it not for Jamie Brett Gabel, who is surprisingly effective as Arthur, this movie would have no redeeming qualities at all.",0
"An update of the skits and jokes you would have seen on a Burlesque stage in the first half of the 20th Century. It's a string of several jokes acted out. Some of them you could tell your Grandmother, some of them not, but it's a fairly safe bet she's heard them all before. For what it tries to be, it's not too bad. Before you rent it, remember that it's an older style of entertainment and has more value as history than as comedy or titillation. Robin Williams has a couple of bits, but he's interchangeable with the other players.",0
"Steven Seagal appears to be sleepwalking through a dreadful movie shot almost entirely in close-up to disguise the complete lack of budget and resources. To pick on the technical flaws - silver F/A-18s and F-14s take of from a carrier for an air-strike, and miraculously become camouflaged F-16s for the actual strike - would give this movie more credibility than it deserves. Suffice it to say that the most interesting thing in the movie is the credit titles which fade on and then disappear in a lightning wipe, which presumably is available to all users of Final Cut Pro. Putting all your creativity into your own credit puts Michael Keusch in the same category as Marcel Mandu.",0
"A very close and sharp discription of the bubbling and dynamic emotional world of specialy one 18year old guy, that makes his first experiences in his gay love to an other boy, during an vacation with a part of his family.I liked this film because of his extremly clear and surrogated storytelling , with all this ""Sound-close-ups"" and quiet moments wich had been full of intensive moods.",0
"This film was absolutely BRILLIANT!! Every performance in this film is excellent, especially Jake Gyllenhaal and Chris Cooper. It looks like Mr Gyllenhaal will have a HUGE film career if this is anything to go by. I thought that Joe Johnston was an odd choice as director as he is usually associated woth big budget blockbusters(Jumanji, Honey I shrunk the kids). He pulls of every scene with sheer class. My favourite scene was where Homer is going down the mineshaft and looking at the sky, going down, as all of his dreams were, it was beautiful. Joe Johnston should direct more of these brilliant, acting driven films as well as his Big budget blockbuster faire, which is also excellent. KUDOS!! to all involved in this masterpiece!",0
"I've heard about this documentary for so long I knew I needed to take the time to watch it. As a documentary it's very well done, in that it takes a neutral observant view of their experience. There are no voice-overs, or interviewing. It is honest. It is true. It is also humbling. Two comments really stayed with me after the film was done. One was how the boys are told to not to become like the American boys who wear the baggy pants, and how in Africa there is time but no money, but in America there is money but no time. The biggest impact was how the boys hungered for education, and how one of the boys totally relocated himself so he could go to school. I watched this film with a high school sophomore who said it upset him to see how the boys were brought to their new life without any real orientation to America. He also said he knew so many American teens who simply cannot appreciate howblessed their lives are in America. I would agree with him on both accounts. A strong film that will leave a person thinking about many things.",0
"I just saw this at the Castro Theatre in San Francisco and had trouble staying awake during this incredibly repetitive, unenlightening little film. It is a 75 minutes film that felt like 175 minutes and has about 20 minutes of modestly engaging material. It's not bad in any offensive way, it just repeats things that have been said many, many times over and more interestingly and provocatively. With only a couple of exceptions, the interviews drone on and on and on, making little emotional contact or context to the whole topic. It's more like a ""how to"" guide for something that can't be done anymore. I was alive during the era but felt little connection or nostalgia for what was presented.",0
"Do you like really inventive comedy or do you love ""the wedding crashers"", if the answer is the latter stop reading now. I can't believe this movie is not higher rated. Basically Meadows plays a character not unlike Austin Powers.There are so many inventive moments in this gagorama. From crudity - Leon playing with himself on the porch, the ex boyfriend tricked into eating . . Oh well. To inspired lunacy- clown sex , the Broadway routine, the voice over. Meadows is great as the childish, but very sweet natured Leon. Some great lines ""don't blame the wang"" ""freaky deaky sex world"" too many. . . Why this movie wasn't huge is a mystery. Great comedy.",0
"They have taken a story dear to the people of Edinburgh's heart, a true story and changed it as Hollywood has done before to many a tale. The end result is a movie however well done for those how do not know the story yet totally different and inaccurate. The original movie of this tale that Walt Disney himself oversaw used the right breed dog that is crucial for this tale and did not make that John Grey was anything special he was a poor Shepard who died in poverty at the inn. If you like the story, watch the Disney original for a better heart- warming story. It's a Shame the cast and the potential was there for a terrific remake of a classic tale. Read the book for an accurate occurrence of the story. And if you really like it, you can visit the real Kirkyard in Edinburgh.",0
"I caught this movie the other night on one of the movie channels and I haven't laughed that hard in a long time. This movie was so funny I went out and bought the very next day. I love this type of comedy. It just seemed so real in the way the actors react to the different situations here. I was Rollin. I had never even heard of it and just started watching because of the title ""Seeing Other People"". The title caused me to give it a shot and I'm glad I did. I laughed so hard that it hurt. Now it's part of my collection. I definitely recommend it to all those that enjoy smart-ass type of comedy. I will be watching this one over and over.",0
"First i will say that i am going to be as subjective as I can.There will be some potential spoilers ahead so beware.I hardly ever review movies, but this one in particular i felt i had to review. This movie Final Fantasy 7 Advent Children, based off the ultra popular rpg (Final Fantasy VII) for the ps1 has been in the works for quite some time. After the years of hype and the dozens of trailers (none of which i ever saw, i had only seen stills) this movie got the legions of fans really excited about seeing their favorite characters on the big screen. I myself had played and completed the game a few times like any good fan, and being such a movie freak i was pretty excited myself. So i had thought to myself, ""WHAT COULD GO WRONG?"".Well, the movie started out OK in the first 20 minutes, but then things get out of hand as the movie progressed. Without a doubt, this is the best looking CGI animation around, but that won't help a weak plot, undeveloped characters,and over indulgent action scenes. Here is the story basically. These three silver haired nancy boys in leather who have nothing to do with the game, are supposedly clones of Sephiroth (he's the villain of the game who had supposedly murdered all his supposed clones)are trying to kidnap all the children for some reason that was not really explained all that well, probably to make an army (of kids?) They also center some of the story on some kid named Denzel, i don't know who this kid is, or what his point is, he just seems depressed all the time. So the sephiroth clones also are involved in some kind of scheme involving some disease called geostigma, that only affects the children, this disease seems to cause boredom and small amounts of skin discoloration.So now Cloud must save the day from these guys. Apparently Cloud and his fellow team mates have learned the ability of flight, i felt a little insulted that these characters where flying around a city fighting a dragon and landing on there feet all the time. Maybe if the movie wasn't so over the top, then the view relax into it and then they can be amazed by something incredible. The real problem of this movie is logic. Now i know what you are gonna say, ""But it's called Final FANTASY! it should have those ideas in it!"" well that is a foolish way to think, the game based itself in some kind of reality and the movie should follow through in that CONTEXT. Context and logic in this movie is inconsistent, i could explain it all, but if i did, i would end up writing the screenplay.Also some scenes in this movie were extremely contrived and trite. like when all of the characters from the game show up just in the nick of time for their obligatory screen time so as not to upset the fans. They show up, do there bit and pretty much have no point in the story.If this is too long here is the simpler review-the pros- the first 20 minutes top-notch cgi animation decent action scenes visually stunningthe cons- illogical over indulgent action/ unbalanced action (leaves the viewer jaded at the climax) weak plot super human characters=no suspense the j-rock soundtrack/score (what happened to the orchestra?) Horrible endingBIG TIME SPOILER-Now the ending of this movie really disappointed me. they could have had gone the really cool and sweet ending where cloud dies and meets up with aeris in the after life but after the great battle at the end cloud gets shot in the back, the kinda wound where the bullet blast out through the chest. then cloud has his 100th flashback in the movie and then wakes up in a pool of lifestream. (now i remember the lifestream in the game, but it did not have resurrecting properties, if it did, they could have brought aeris back to life, thus making a completely different story) so cloud is brought back to life and everyone has a party and dives into the pool and we have a ultra cheezy hallmark/ lifetime type moment.not that the movie doesn't have it's moments. its is worth seeing for its visuals. but thats all.other than that it's not really a good movie. it is strictly for blinded fans of the game. not for people who care about plot and character and story telling.",0
"In the last 10 years I have worked in 3 different indie professional wrestling organizations, managed many pro wrestlers (including 2 Backyard Wrestling stars), worked on 2 different wrestling TV programs and did voice-overs and commentary for many wrestling DVD's. I have NEVER witnessed the level of outright amateurish stupidity, lack of talent and skill, and shoddy production quality found in Splatter Rampage Wrestling. To even list this as a wrestling video of ANY kind is an outright misuse of the term. Shot with low-dollar video cameras, it's essentially home videos of kids play-fighting in back yards. The sound quality is bad, the video quality is bad, and the acting is horrendous. The ""wrestlers"" wear makeshift costumes with hand-drawn tee shirts and ski masks and hit each other with a variety of items and halfway imitate wrestling moves. Sometimes the ""matches"" are on the grass. Sometimes on a back yard trampoline. ALL are poorly acted and executed with a shameless lack of any wrestling skill. In short, don't bother with this stinker. Whether your interest in this DVD is entertainment or academic (both in my case), you will be terribly disappointed.",0
"I loved this film!! I have been waiting for this film to come out so I could see it. I saw it opening night and loved it, Some people told me that this film wasn't any good and to stay away but I thought it was great. The actors did great and it was scary and made me jump. Paris Hilton did a great job for her first film, everybody is giving her a hard time when she did great and she didn't even have that big of a role. The set was great has it was made of all wax and how it was made. The two brothers did a great job and the death sense were great. The killers were really scary and made me want to close my eyes and not look at them. I can't wait until this film comes out to Video so I can get it and see it over and over again. The over view of my review is go see this film if you like Hororr films and you will not be sorry I loved this film. I give this film a 10 out of 10 IT ROCKS!!!",0
"I was expecting this to be the same kind of schlock as the previous Modesty Blaise movie, which is why I left it unwatched for so long, but I was very pleasantly surprised.Far from being a succession of silly gun battles and car/boat chases, it was an almost thoughtful analysis of how a pretty girl gets to become as hard as nails, with nothing being overstated or over-rationalized.It's likely that the budgetary constraints actually helped with that: less time and effort was spent on finding ever-stupider ways for stunt men to pretend to die, and more was dedicated to making the movie worth watching. Hell, the biggest gun battle takes place off screen -- and the scene where it is heard is all the better for that background noise, that adds to the suspense -- who's winning? Who's dying?Alexandra Staden might not be as drop-dead gorgeous as Monica Vitti, but few are, and she certainly has every ounce of class and fire that's needed to make the character work -- and the shape of her face, her hair, and her tall, slender body could have been lifted straight from the comic-strip graphics.Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau was the perfect choice for a Blaise bad-guy, in that he made the character interesting and enjoyable to watch -- even likable (and I doubt I'd consider taking on many brutal, psychopathic murderers as drinking buddies). I can't think of a single one of Hollywood's ""former waiters"" who could have pulled the role off that well.Fortunately, Blaise baddies always die, in the end (no spoilers there!) That's a really good thing, because all the girls who would have spent their time swooning over such a disgustingly handsome and interesting hunk can now pragmatically settle for us ordinary Joes.",0
"Considering its popularity, I found this movie a huge disappointment. Maybe I was expecting too much from this film. After all, it is one of the most well known martial arts films of the 1970s, but I could never figure out why. The story is uninteresting. It is also a very talky movie with sporadic action sequences. My biggest problem with the movie was that the story does not offer a character that I could root for, since the intended hero is an idiot. Director Chang has no sense of style, and he is unable to hide the glaring imperfections found in the narrative. I know this is not supposed to be high art, but I found the movie boring. Definitely not the best example of this much-beloved genre. Its cult status escapes me. I recommend you to skip it.",0
"I've read a lot of comments about the film and how it's so hard for people to believe that it is a sequel to Henry Fool, and even though it technically is, I think that Fay Grim needs to be looked at as an entirely different film. Just because it is the sequel doesn't mean that it has to be a direct continuation of the first, and I enjoyed that so much about it. The whole point of the film was to change direction from the first, which makes sense because the movie isn't called Henry Fool 2, it's Fay Grim. All that aside, the film, I thought, was so well made and thought out that it actually surprised me. I was expecting to rent another nearly-released-straight-to-video film and have to endure 2 hours of bad editing and an almost hard to follow story-line (aka parker's last direct to video feature the Oh in Ohio) but this was so surprisingly well focused that it almost doesn't seem so, which I absolutely loved. There are so many nuances in the film making and writing that I crave to see in films, but never do. The cinematography was brilliant due to it's simplicity and truly making the film seem 'Grim' throughout - in terms of setting. The writing was so well put together as well, whoever said this movie isn't as witty as Henry Fool needs to watch again and actually listen; I almost can't even begin to explain how actually hilarious it was, and pertinent. And well, Parker Posey, who could complain? The scene in which Fool and Jalal were talking in the dark was so captivating and emotional. And I thought the spy-ness throughout the film was just so hilarious and spot on (in hindsight because i do agree that at times during you kind of felt lost). The main thing that struck me so powerfully about the film, and i believe the point of the film, was Parker's love and naivety about Fool, which was so endearing and turned, yes very quickly, from denial to outright passion. The last five minutes of the film were perfect. Obviously there were things that weren't excellent, but nothing is perfect; some of the acting was poor, and at times I did think that some of the new back story and dialogue about terrorism got a little hard to follow and out of hand, but in the end you got it and didn't even mind that at the time it may have slipped from your comprehension. (This may also have to do with Goldblum's tendency to talk extremely fast) On the whole I would say that it was probably one of the best films I've seen this year; stylistically pleasing, clever and witty writing, performances that were so impressive I now have gained new respect for some of the actors, and a truly touching film, and don't forget, a complete departure from Fool. Which was the point.",0
I am truly beginning to believe that Seagal is on a mission to see how crappy his films could become.This particular movie was a complete and utter waste of time to see.My first complaint was the cover of the DVD where they have doctored his pic and made him look slimmer and younger when in the film he looks like crap.He has his big pot belly and double chin going for him and the most miserable and bored look on his face.The whole plot was ridiculous to begin with and drawn out way too long.The whole film was leading up to the finale where Seagal and his team had to take on a bunch of people under the influence of a top secret military chemical adrenaline enhancer.There was way too much useless dialogue and not to mention the ridiculous and constant dubbing of Seagals voice even in the middle of a statement.The dubbed voice sounded like a man with a frog in his throat and was quite comical.The fight scenes in the film were horrible.Half the time when Seagal fought you could not even see what was going on.There would be tight shots of him flapping his arms at the camera and then the person flying through a wall or something.It was reminiscent of the old Kung Fu series on television.They used way too much slow motion for the fight scenes.I believe this is Seagals worst film to date and I am glad I did not purchase this film or I would have been very upset since I am a huge fan of Seagal the Aikidoist.The action star is quickly fading away and seems to be getting worse with every performance.,0
"""Delusion"" is what you experience when you watch this flick and then believe you saw something worthwhile. This flick, which tells of a trio of semi-psycho travelers who are up to no good somewhere in the CA desert, is amateurish and just plain stupid. The film suffers from an awful story, a lousy screenplay, and some terrible direction just to mention a few of the deficits. If the flick has anything at all going for it, it's B-movie diva Rubin's even performance. Don't waste your time on this turkey. (D)",0
"Nothing really unpredictable in this movie, but a solid flick in all respects. Everything from acting to cinematography was solid. Not a perfectly linear plot line, but there wasn't anything you couldn't see coming. Perhaps a tad melodramatic at points, but again, a fairly decent movie none the less. Definitely worth checking out. If in doubt of what film to rent over the weekend, give this a go. Though you may not feel like running out and buying it, I found it to be quite worth while.",0
"What movie is this??? A horrible movie with the old boring concept of infidelity which has already been achieved by the ""Bhatt camp"". The movie starrs EMRAAN HASHMI, UDITA GOSWAMI AND DINO MOREA. The movie has ""No Base"". It just goes like this... Dino an Udita are married and living in a rich mansion. However Dino doesn't like Udita to the heart as he wants only her wealth. He loves someone else (Tara Sharma). So he bribes Emraan to have an affair with Udita so that he could catch them and finally split up with Udita.. How BORING!! However Emraan falls in love with Udita and vice versa. Lastly when Udita gets imprisonment for killing Emraan, Dino pretentiously tries to save her showing his false love to her. Udita on the other hand does not understand this and feels that he loved her truly. So she lends all her wealth to Dino. Finally Dino comes out of the police - station and goes with Tara with all the wealth. What a fraud!! The songs are good and are the only thing good in the movie. Now the individual ratings: (Out of 5) Emraan: * * Udita: * 1/2 Dino : * 1/2 Overall acting: * 1/2 Direction: * * Story: * Music: * * * 1/2 Final rating: * 1/2 Poor performances and poor casting....... Music: Good... I rate the movie: 1.5 / 10 (Dont waste your time !!!!)",0
A movie about a son's (RK) love for his father (AK) and to what extreme he goes to destroy and execute those who want to harm his father! The movies focus is on RK who nailed his role perfectly as the animal he becomes on the road of revenge! Anil Kapoor played his role well. Rashmika's role wasn't special could have been played by any actress the rest of the cast were good. Bobby Deol's extended cameo ( only came at the end part of the movie) was pure swagger mixed with rage should have used more time on his character. Overall first half was epic but slows down after the interval the movie could have been shorter but if u like RK and love brutal loud action scenes then go watch it! *Not one for the family (very violent and has repetitive pointless kissing scenes and partial nudity) 7.5/10 ,0
"KGF was the most awaited movie after the success of 1st chapter and the sequel is getting way better response. But when I compare to many other south action/drama flicks it is over the top in all areas. Acting is average, direction is avg, screenplay average and story is basically inspired by many other movies like Scarface, Agneepath etc etc. The only thing I liked about this movie is music and BGM. And for this only reason you can watch it in the cinema halls.",0
"KGF 2 is overrated. Only Sanjay Dutt made it look like a real gangster movie, rest everything was in slow motion, too much heroic shots for the hero, the biggest drawback of South Indian movies. Also didn't connect with the hype that kgf has the deepest secret in chapter two.",0

"If you are about to book a ticket for this movie going by the collections in the news, stop right now. A complete demolition of the image and fanbase created by the original Gadar, this movie showcases why it was made - just to mint money in the shadow of the former legendary film. With no planning, script or direction, this movie will bore the hell out of you and you will be left regretting your decision of booking the tickets. A three hour of complete nonsense in any manner you take it. A child could write a better script. Sunny deol is depicted as a superman too, taking on hundreds of men armed with guns and that too multiple times - barehanded. LOL.",0
"Same old drama storyline, nothing new. Pushpa 2 fails to live up to the expectations set by Pushpa 1. While Pushpa 1 captivated audiences with its gripping storyline, strong character arcs, and engaging performances, the sequel falls flat. The narrative feels recycled and lacks the freshness of the original. The characters are poorly utilized, with many sidelined or reduced to cliched roles. The songs are not only forgettable but often feel inappropriate, disrupting the film's flow. Despite the hype, Pushpa 2 struggles to deliver a cohesive and compelling experience, leaving fans disappointed.",0
"What a movie... I was literally blown away by the dedication and acting of Rishabh Shetty. You need guts to pick the topic and execute in such a nice way. Mark my words this movie will get National Award. BGM, cinematography, direction and acting all were topnotch. Final 20 minutes of climax is unbelievable... never expected Rishabh Shetty got such an acting skill. Achyutha Kumar, Kishore acted really well...

What the hell did the maker or Director do in starting with and finishing an Army team/troops like a cockroach with only 4 men without getting firing training? Randeep Hooda killed every army person with every bullet! How was that possible? Also, for a 100 crore budget movie, mr Old Sunny took 50 crore and the rest 50 for making this comedy circus? I thought if that army came from BSF, then the show would change with another story. Where they make their troops like a hero, actually they are like a cat, who kills innocents and acts like they are the best! Very ridiculous movie this is.",0
"The movie feels like it has a ChatGPT generated script with not much else. Some scenes are supposed to be emotional but turn out to be funny due to the lack of inherent logic in them. Some dialogues were so predictable, proper cringe romcom which has a (surprise, surprise) happy ending which again does not make sense at all. Ahaan Pandey speaks like he has the Caps Lock button on in his throat throughout the movie. Proper brainrot timepass, do watch it only if you want to go for a movie for the sake of going to for a movie at all. The songs are the only saving grace for the movie in my opinion.",0
"I honestly loved Saiyaara. In today's world where most films glorify toxic relationships and ""break-up culture,"" it feels like we've forgotten what real love stories are meant to feel like. This movie reminded me of hat. It's for people who truly understand love, with all its depth and sacrifice. If anyone finds it ""cringe,"" maybe it's because they haven't experienced what genuine love can actually do.As a mental health professional, I did notice one inconsistency: the speed of the female lead's Alzheimer's progression, that to me felt a little dramatized. But honestly, that's a small detail in the bigger picture. The film as a whole was beautiful, emotional, and truly refreshing.Loved it... loved the story, loved the music, loved the love.",0
"First of all it is important to thank Vidhu Vinod Chopra for making this film. The story has been told in such a heartwarming way that the audience is totally involved in this inspiring story of grit, determination and victory against all odds. The performances are award worthy. Vikram Massey is outstanding in the lead role and is well supported by the rest of the cast. The direction, screenplay and editing are top notch. Unfortunately in India the over the top and illogical films become blockbusters and the really outstanding films don't do well commercially. I hope the Indian audience views such films as it will encourage film makers to do top quality work of international standards. This film falls in category that the Hindi film industry should feel proud of.",0

The romance between lead pairs was written perfectly. The love story and the movie will clinch your heart. Don't miss this classic in theatres.",0
"Because the movie had such a high rating on IMDb I was intrigued. Bollywood movies are not particularly on the top of my list I must admit. But I gave it a shot and I'm glad I did. It only has two scenes where they start singing and dancing so that was not too much. Why they start singing and dancing that I will never get. The story does not need that at all. The story itself was very pleasant to follow. Full of mixed emotions, happy ones and sad ones. The cast and the filming was great. All actors gave a good performance throughout the whole movie. Like in most American television series they want to give you a lesson in life and most of the time it makes me want to barf but in this Bollywood movie it works perfectly well. I had fun watching this and I get why I am not the only one. Certainly worth a watch.",0
Absolutely brilliant script packed with many surprise moments and deserving climax. Never expected that the second part would take the brilliance of original movie. The movie has its ups and downs and did lag at times ( especially first half) . Definitely missed theatrical experience,0
"Just returned home after watching first show of CE. first half is superb, SRK impresses with his comic role, makes u remember his movies like bad shah, duplicate. There are almost no songs in first half, which is great. Problems comes in second half, typical Bollywood problem, song after song. It makes the film drag. For first half i will give 4.5 out of 5 stars and for second half 2.5 out of 5. I don't think this movie will have repeat audience like 3 idiots. But people will definitely enjoy it at least once. My only disappointment was second half. Watch CE if you are a SRK or Deepika fan, you will not get disappointed. But if you are looking for perfect then this is not the movie. But still good time pass",0

The movie makers were definitely very creative Character design could've been better though. They could work on body anatomy, the textures, etc. But overall it was so so worth watching. They have shown the movie in a way people of this generation would love. The action was so good, entertainment was so good, it's like people wouldn't be bored and they'll understand our culture and our history. They made sure we learn about our culture in a fun way and don't feel pressured.",0

Don 2 was an amazing movie. Great acting by Shahrukh Khan probably one of his best acting. A well directed movie my Farhan Akhtar. The dialogs were great. The storyline was sometimes predictable but at the end it totally changes. It was a slick movie. When I watched the movie I thought I was watching a Hollywood movie. Shahrukh Khan is the only actor who can play Don cause he has that style the charisma and everything that u need in an underworld king who wants to be the king of Europe. Boman Irani plays the role of Vardhan really well. I think they should make Don 3 with a different location and with even better storyline. From my side i would give 7/10.,0
"Great movie seen in Bollywood as action, thrill, story line, direction, suspense all along. overall Power-packed performance by Shahrukh Khan. Truly the KING IS BACK. People said that no-one could make a better Don than the man himself, Amitabh Bachchan. However, I would like to disagree. Shahrukh is the only actor of todays time that could ever make it better than the original. His style, charisma and witty remarks make it all the more appealing. Farhan Akhtar's superb directing made this film epic! There are no gaps, no over-the-top parts. As a director Farhan's best film ever. Film's background score is stunning. But the songs are not pretty good. The film's visual effects is better than MI-4, Ra.One, Robot, Krissh. It's stunning and well shot. The special effects add a special flavor to the film which makes it even more delicious. Each and every character in this film is perfect. But in some portion it remembers me Death Race2, specially in Jail. Anyway best movie of the year.",0
"Houseful 2 – CATCH IT (B+) Houseful is an out and out entertainment, the story and situations are not jell well together but still it manages to make your roll on floor laughing. Akshay Kumar finally in his best foam after 3 years of disastrous movies & performances. John Abraham, Reitesh & Sheryas are hilarious and their timing with Akshay is perfect. Asin and Jacqueline are the main lead and looked gorgeous along with Zarine Khan and Shazahn Padamsee. Mithun, Rishi and Randhir Kapoor & Boman Irani were perfect. All the girls and boys have terrific chemistry and looked great together. Songs and cinematography is refreshing. Overall great entertainment but mistakes in story and screenplay are apparent.",0
"The performance by Vinay Pathak is brilliant and so is Lara Dutta. It is a fun ride with emotional side as well. When it's over you'll feel you watched something nice and will feel good in your heart, also you'll find movies like Chalo Dilli online.",0
Beautiful road movie with a lesson in life. Both Vinay Pathak and Lara Dutta are excellent..,0
"This film is often compared to its Hollywood influences, Quentin Tarantino and the Godfather, but in my opinion Gangs of Wasseypur actually outdo these. The level of scope and detail are unparalleled and makes the audience feel like they are really living in these time periods. The balancing act of so many characters is achieved deftly and with great actors who bring a strong sense of brutal ambition. This is an epic in the true sense of the term with technical perfection and an incredible story.",0
"Gangs of Wasseypur stands firmly on the grounds of direction, acting, screenplay, story-line, cinematography & music. Manoj Pandey has delivered an outstanding performance. The movie has to be rated ""A"" because of a lot of abuses (which implies, its not a family flick). But the essence of it is demanding and commendable. Everyone has done a splendid job. This one is not loose even for a minute. The most important aspect of its appreciation is its star-cast. A lot of new faces and still it doesn't disappoint. You can just imagine the crew on board when actors like Piyush Mishra & Yashpal Sharma are totally wasted. An entertaining cinema worth watching. There is no doubt that Anurag Kashyap is Bollywood's Quentin Tarantino. A must watch.",0
"Earlier to, many movies tried to capture the incidents of Gujarat but this piece of work stands out from all of them. Beautifully and sensibly linking all of them with great success. Movie for not even a second deviate audiences. Million time watchable movie. And amazingly great work by the actors specially by the little kid Ali. So true in his cricketing skills. Great casting by the group.Great direction work.Music very different with studded Gujarati words and appeals all us north Indians. And purely one way a family movie which touches a bit from every person's life in the country and binds everyone with the highly accepted religion of cricket. Cons: should have been extended 1 hour more.",0
"Well I was not excited enough for this movie, but when the trailers started coming and then the music, my curiosity began to flourish little bit. But the main reason I went to saw this movie was because I heard almost 50-60 review from my friends and not even single person had a negative review against it. And when I saw this, it really blew me away because it had many mixtures which made this movie work. First of all FARHAN AKHTER is at its best, no doubt its his best performance till date. It was like we were seeing real Milkha Singh on screen. Divya Dutta is awesome, Pavan Malhotra, Yograj Singh & Prakash Raj have really performed well. Sonam Kapoor is completely waste though her role was very little, so you won't miss her. Rebecca Breeds looks fabulous, Dilip Tahil as Jawahar Lal Nehru was not a master stroke. Screenplay was good, music was fabulous and the background score really kept the life in each and every scene. Rakesh Omprakash Mehra's best work till date also. YOU DARE TO MISS THIS ONE ON YOUR OWN RISK !!!",0
"What a movie ! awesome the way farhan act ,the way rakeysh directed ,everything movie was superb and all the time it has mesmerized the audience through out the movie .Again no word to appreciate farhan acting ,he is a extremely talented actor and he showed up in the same way .My Voting for this is 4.5 out of 5 .In terms of IMDb I am amazed till now I am not seeing any rating of the movie and saying waiting for 5 vote for commencing the voting ,any how this movie is a purely inspired by the milkha singh . I Like the way flash back was going on ,it was a shattering flashback that was amazing to watch ,every time when the movie was going in the flashback it was awesome experience to watch it .love this movie .",0
"What can I say? I went to watch this movie after reading all the reviews online - Therefore with high expectations. Well, I was still blown over by the movie or should I say DHANUSH! Ranjhanaa is based on a topic that is so far reaching and yet is that much more realistic! Every scene is delicately handled and the emotional parts were so subtle.Everyone in the screen just melted away and got hazy when Dhanush was in it. He makes you laugh, cry, hate him, and sympathize with him at the same time. AR Rahman's music was divine and seamlessly blended with the storyline. Excellent performances by the whole cast - But Dhanush owns the movie! A definite must watch!!!",0
"Lovely movie, it had a twist and a blend of action, drama, romance, a little bit fiction too. The movie is worth a watch. it displays the actuality of the people, their nature and all i loved the romantic part of the movie as well. it was fun, interesting and very very entertaining too. I seriously recommend it to be watched. it has a little bit abuses which aren't suitable for a child's attention. if you are looking for a movie to watch for fun, to cry, to feel love, experience pain,i am pretty astonished about ""Dhanush"" as this was his first movie in the Bollywood and he made his mark pretty high. People it must be watched at least once, and i am very sure about going to the cinemas to see it again Enjoy, It is not something either that will get you bored during the movie. The movie has brilliant direction, acting. For me its a 11/10",0
I absolutely loved it. It had such an impact on me that i couldn't stop thinking about it whole night. The cinematography was ethereal. The direction was beautiful. I've always loved Imtiaz Ali's direction. I don't know why people criticize him. He is one of the best directors we've in bollywood. The cinematic understanding that this guy have is unbelievable. RANDEEP HOODA man o man what a breathetaking performance. He absolutely nailed Mahabir's character. This has to be the most underrated performance in years. The guy is seriously talented and deserves much more than he's getting. Alia Bhatt was amazing. Considering it was just her 2nd film she did exceptionally well. The real hero of the movie was Imtiaz Ali. The layers that he put in the characters can only be done by an artist with exceptional talent. 4.5/5 from my side.,0
"Another great work by Imtiaz Ali. The film is made for a mature audience. It shows the bond between a poor kidnapper truck driver and a rich girl. Not so new concept but still wonderful to watch. Its not a typical love story, its something new and refreshing.It's a little unrealistic but if you leave that unrealistic fact then it is a wonderful film.Superb acting by both the actors. Randeep Hooda did an amazing job with his intense character role. From Alia Bhatt,honestly speaking I wasn't expecting much from her after her first film SOTY, but after this film I am expecting her to go to in the top Bollywood actress category in few years. Overall its a good and emotional film. Beautiful work by Anil Mehta too (cinematographer). Go for it. Don't listen to the stupid Indian critics.",0
This film has got some real good talents like ShahRukh Khan and Alia bhatt. The ultimate message of the film is also great but the entire plot is really weak. There is no hook in the story which makes it stand out the rest. Though the Psychologist and patient relationship is shown good enough but the lead protagonist has no deep back story. A lot was expected out of this one but kind of misfits the Story part.,0
"A beautiful cinematic experience. This movie makes you: laugh, shed a few good tears, feel happy, rethink about your own life, fall in love with Alia, fall in love with SRK all over again. To add to these, it has lovely direction, cinematography and background score! When it comes to acting, everyone has done a fab job. Alia is winning best actress award for sure. SRK was the right choice for this supporting role; I am so glad a Superstar like him agreed to do this role. All other actors were perfect too. After Zoya Akhtar, Gauri Shinde brings new hope to storytelling in Bollywood. Go watch it at a theater near u! Its high time Indian audience supports movies like these. Love you Zindagi!",0
Sushant's acting is uncomparable. His dedication and hard work pays off on the screen.,0
"You go inside the theater as a Dhoni fan but you come out as Sushant's fan. He has really worked hard for this film, you can see it in the movie. At times you forget that you are watching Sushant and not actually Dhoni. He portrays everything so well including that helicopter shot!!",0
A delight to watch. U won't blink your eyes even for a min. Superb script and direction. Perhaps the best Hindi movie ever in my opinion. Must watch guys. U will enjoy a lot. Trust me! Dhoni is the biggest superstar in cricketing world and u will love it. The movie scene in which Sushant Singh Rajput hits the ball for six over long on is so terrific that u will actually feel that the 2011 world cup final is going on in the cinema hall. U will relieve the moment once again in your life. The commitment and dedication level of Sushant Singh Rajput is fantastic. U will never see someone work as hard as he did for a movie. Must visit guys if you are a true Indian cricket team fan. Lots of exciting things to explore in the movie.,0
The movie is not good as expected and the reason is that the writer chooses to focus on the emotional nagging instead of the great content which could build a great story. Performance by Sushant Singh is truly brilliant and MS Dhoni's hard work and commitment towards his work is commendable but the loophole are the supporting actors. The two actresses Disha and Kiara have done average performances and Bhoomika as Dhoni's sister is not convincing enough. Too many songs in the movie spoil the screenplay. The only factor which makes the viewer going is his/her love for the real captain Cool and the sacrifices and efforts he takes to reach to the top. Overall I would recommend the movie as a one time watch but honestly Neeraj could have been much better,0
I'm Sushant fab after watching this film ..what an actor he is !,0
